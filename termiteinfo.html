                    <h4>What They Look Like</h4>
                    <img src="images/wingedtermite.png" width="254" height="168" class="img-responsive  shade">
                    <p>If you have Drywood Termites, the first thing you will notice is sawdust/sand fecal pellets. You'll also start noticing damage. Sometimes you might actually see the 
                        termites as they swarm out at the end of the summer season.
                        Although you will notice these termites predominately in the summer window the termites are eating your home all year long, 24 hours a day. Just because
                        you don't see them does not mean they are not there. This is why an experienced and trusting termite inspector should be called. We will take a look at your 
                        home free of charge. Captain Termite Control provides traditional fumigation methods as well as alternative spot treatments.
                        </p>
                    <h4>HOW DID DRYWOOD TERMITES ENTER MY HOME?</h4> 
                    <p>Drywood Termites are airborne. They will fly in, swarming in from a neighbor's house, from vegetation around the exterior of your home or 
                        property line fences.
                    </p>
                    <h4>WILL THE TERMITES COME BACK AFTER TREATMENT?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, they likely will come back. Make it our responsibility to make sure you will never have to worry about termites again. Ask your inspector about 
                        a full structure minimal warranty.
                    </p>

                <h2> SUBTERRANEAN TERMITES</h2>
                <h4>What They Look Like</h4>
                <p><img src="images/subtermite_closer.jpg" width="254" height="168" class="img-responsive img-circle shade"> 
                <p>Winged termites are swarming wood eaters usually seen during the spring months. They get their name by living
                    in the soil in colonies. They travel from their colonies in the soil to their food source (homes, scrap
                    wood, cardboard, etc). Whether your home is raised or on a slab foundation they will find a way in.</p>
                <h4>HOW DID SUBTERRANEAN TERMITES ENTER MY HOME?</h4>
                <img src="images/tunnelUpWall.jpg" width="254" height="168" class="img-responsive img-circle shade">  
                    <p>If your structure is raised these termites will enter the home easily through mud shelter tubes traveling
                        as far and as long as necessary to get to their food source. Therefore, we suggest that you have your
                        sub area inspected periodically.</p>
                    <p>If you are on a slab foundation these termites find their way up from the soil through cracks in the
                        foundation, around plumbing, cement expansion joints, and other areas that give them access to your
                        structure. They are attracted to moisture and wood/cellulose debris. Subterranean colonies can be
                        eradicated by a soil treatment.
