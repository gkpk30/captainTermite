                <h3>Precision Injection</h3>
                <p>Precision injection is a spot treatment where we inject PremiseII or Termidor directly into the wood that
                    contains termite colonies. We basically fill the tunnels in the wood that the colony has created and
                    fill them up. After spot treatments a coat of Bora-Care is sprayed over the wood.
                </p>
                <p>Because this a localized treatment type homeowners can be home while we work. It only takes a couple of hours
                    for our experienced specialist to finish.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Borate Treatment</h3>
                <p> Used in spot treatments, foam treatments and preventative treatments the environmentally–benign borate preservatives
                    dehydrate the termites and effectively eliminates them.
                </p>
                <p> We use Timbor and Bora-Care in it's liquid form which provides a better application as we broadcast the spray
                    over the wood. This treatment method is a well–established technology with a proven track record – treated
                    wood has been used safely and effectively around the world for over 60 years. It's an appropriate choice
                    to protect indoor wood products from wood–destroying termites, carpenter ants, powderpost beetles, mold
                    and fungi. </p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Foam Treatment</h3>
                <p>You can agree that the worst place to get termites is inside your walls where they can't be seen. Our termite
                    specialist carefully drills a 1/16th hole in between the studs of your wall. Then pushes the soapy foam
                    Borate treatment as it soaks into the sides of the studs. This treatment is effective at protecting the
                    insides of the walls making a protective alternative to traditional tenting.

                <h3>Preventative Treatment</h3>
                <p>Preventative treatments is a plan that include any combination of Soil, Foam or Injection treatments that
                    will create the protective barrier against subterranean or dry wood termites. </p>

                <h3>Pre-Construction Treatment</h3>
                <p>A preventative treatment process that works against subterranean termites and their colonies. Applications
                    of Termidor during the pre-construction phase of your home or business will safeguard you from termite
                    infestation.</p>

                <h3>Soil Treatments</h3>
                <p>You can't tent fumigate against subterranean termites and their branching colonies. Our specialists will
                    crawl underneath your home or carefully drill through the slab to create a protective barrier around
                    the perimeter and underneath your home. Think of it as a protective "moat" around the exterior of the
                    house specifically targeting subterranean termites. The months of February and March marks the beginning
                    of subterranean termite season.</p>

                <h3>Cellulose Removal</h3>
                <p>Homeowners know that termites have a reputation of eating wood. Termites get their nutrition from eating
                    cellulose debris such as paper, cardboard and lumber that has been forgotten underneath your house.

                <h3>Traditional Tent Fumigation</h3>
                <p>Traditional Tent fumigation is an all inclusive treatment type against dry wood termites. We essentially
                    bag your entire home, building or business. Tent fumigation is so effective that it is extremely rare
                    to have recurring termite problems because it will most likely eliminate 100% of dry wood termites. We
                    use Vakane gas when other termite companies use cheaper, inferior and less effective gas products. </p>
                <p>Nowadays tent fumigation is much less evasive or as inconvenient for the customer as it once was. Because
                    we use Vakane gas you will not need to clean your floors, wash your dishes, or wash your clothes after
                    the tent fumigation. Captain Termite Control can thoroughly explain the process to you and will offer
                    you tips and pointers to prepare you for fumigation. We will also provide you with free bags for your
                    food.</p>
